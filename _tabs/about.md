## Early Years and Global Influence

I was born and raised between India and Oman, the firstborn son of a government employee and a retired teacher. My childhood was filled with books, exploration, and curiosity about the world. Travel became a defining aspect of my life—solo backpacking across the vast and diverse landscapes of India instilled in me a deep appreciation for cultural nuance, adaptability, and the ability to navigate the unknown. These experiences cultivated a mindset of resilience and openness, values that continue to guide me today.

## Life in Oman

Oman played a formative role in shaping my worldview. My family saw our time there as an extended adventure, seizing every opportunity to travel across the Middle East. From the bustling streets of the UAE to the rich history of Saudi Arabia and the untouched landscapes of Yemen, I gained firsthand insights into different cultures, governance models, and ways of life. These early encounters with diversity shaped my ability to connect with people from all backgrounds and understand the broader global context.

## Back in India

India, for me, is synonymous with friendships, growth, and discovery. My final years of high school, undergraduate studies, and early professional life were filled with moments of learning, challenge, and self-discovery. I pursued Civil Engineering at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, and graduated in 2020. While engineering provided a strong analytical foundation, it was during this time that I explored my passion for data, technology, and business strategy. My experiences in analytics and leadership began here, setting me on the path I follow today.

## A New Chapter in London

In August 2022, I embarked on an exciting journey to London, one of the world’s foremost financial and technological hubs. My goal is to bring my expertise in data science, AI, and business strategy to an international stage, learning from diverse perspectives and making a tangible impact in the evolving world of AI and technology. My professional experience spans roles in banking, consulting, and AI-driven SaaS, where I have applied data science and machine learning to drive business transformation.

## Values

The three guiding values that I stand by are:

- **Curiosity** – Everything I am stems from a deep-seated curiosity about the world—constantly asking *why?* and *why not?* in every aspect of my life. This is my passion, and I will stop at nothing to pursue my innate need to explore and wonder.
- **Freedom** – The freedom to truly be myself is a principle I live by. I believe values are internal, and I will always strive to be my most authentic self.
- **Connection** – As humans, we are nothing without genuine connection. With curiosity and freedom, I seek to build meaningful relationships with both like-minded and diverse individuals.

This is my motivation to build impactful tools and systems that enable the world to flourish into a better future.
