# Jomal Jochan

I'm Jomal and I like to describe myself as a curious mind looking out into the world, asking myself how I can best serve humanity.

![About](assets/images/about_me.jpeg)


I was born and raised in India & Oman. First born son of a Government employee and a retired teacher, I was always encouraged to read, learn and explore during my childhood. From this conditioning, I fell in love with travelling - travelling solo to the corners of India; my culturally and geographically diverse home country, gave me the peace of mind and confidence to look further outward. Backpacking through the vast swathes of land and cultures of India is what I would suggest to any aspiring traveler looking to get lost among the mountains, rivers and beaches.

## Early life in Oman

My time in Oman has been a blur for the most part. As this was during the formative years of my childhood, it is a big part of who I am. My family considered our stay in Oman as an extended vacation, travelling across the countries of the middle east every chance we got. Oman, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Yemen; countries with varied cultures and wildly different government systems and backgrounds, through these trips, I learned how good and how cruel the world can be.

## Back in India

The one word that could describe my time in India would be Friends. Through my final high school years, undergrad and my 2 years of working, the highlight was always the people I was with. This was a time when I connected, got lost, heart-broken, got confident again and learned to tread the world with no regrets. I am happy to say that after this roller-coaster ride, I am left with a handful of real friends I can lean on at any point in time.

To do my undergrad in Civil Engineering, I enrolled myself to BITS Pilani University and graduated in 2020. During my 4 years in Hyderabad, I explored many different career options & passions which finally led me to a satisfying career in analytics & leadership.

## New journey in London

From August 2022, I have started on a new adventure in the financial capital of the world, London. I wish to be able to take my experiences and add an international outlook; fresh perspectives and new cultures which will help me grow to achieve my full potential.
