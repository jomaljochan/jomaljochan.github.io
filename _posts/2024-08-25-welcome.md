```c++
Hello world!
```

I wanted to start this with the 2 words I started coding with.

I'm Jomal & I am an engineer with a background in `Data Science` and a curiosity for how things work in the world.

As `Deep Learning` proved to work better and better at scale, I was fascinated by the opportunities that lie ahead. Companies have started building tools on the infrastructure laid out by foundation models, but we seem to have reached a ceiling on the data available naturally. The next step would be artificially generated data to complement the massive scaling of compute.

I can see a point when a single person is able to build their own companies through agentic systems that can think and execute larger projects.

I look forward to such a future where I can build the solutions that excite me and share it with the world. Until such a time becomes a reality, I will share my excitement about the developments of such systems here.

Thank you and see you all very soon!
